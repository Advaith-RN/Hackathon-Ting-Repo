SpotFinder : The app to find parking spots around you

This project focuses on solving a longstanding issue : finding a parking spot.
The app finds and highlights free parking spaces near you. \
Once you occupy the spot, you can scan a QR code that lets the app know that this spot is occupied.
For future implementation, the code can also be replaced by a sensor that checks the availability of the spot.

Successfully reporting spots give you credits, which you can use to reserve other parking spots in advance.
